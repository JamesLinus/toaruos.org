# ToAruOS (とあるOS) #

とあるOS (ToAruOS) is a hobby kernel and supporting userspace, built mostly from scratch, in development since December of 2010.

It was originally developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. For a period of time, it was the development focus of the university's [SIGOps](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/sigops/) chapter.

とあるOS is open source, released under the NCSA/University of Illinois license. Sources are available [on github](https://github.com/klange/toaruos).
